## Power BI
We use Microsoft Power BI for all of our recurring reporting. The advantages of using Power BI:

Streamlined Distribution of Reports - Instead of emailing large Excel files or putting them into OneDrive, or using our current mix of products, our Analysts can compile tables, charts, and interactive visualizations directly to PowerBI.com with a direct connection to the Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW). This provides fewer breakpoints for the data and a faster turnaround time on any modifications.
Near Real-Time Information - Because the reports are connected directly to the EDW, we can provide faster and more seamless data refreshes. Any report can be updated daily, or even multiple times a day.
Self-Service Capabilities - You are in control of how and when you receive your data. Want data exported to Excel? Simply click on the data and export it. Want it to come to your World Vision email on a certain schedule? Subscribe to the report. Want to filter and deep dive into the data? Any field in the EDW can become a filter for you to interact with inside Power BI.

## Report Library
Each of our reports are available on our Power BI app. An app is a collection of Power BI reports that Prospect Development has chosen to group in various categories. To find our app, you can go to Powerbi.com, login, select “Apps” from the left navigation, and select "Prospect Development or simply click here! Below is a full list and brief description of each report.
